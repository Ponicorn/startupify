# Startupify

A generator for the most important part of any successful startupt in 2016 : Homepage.

Its build with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and the nice pictures come from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

ps: Since it use rocket science css property like "background-clip: text;", IE & Firefox will totally fuck it up in some rendering.
And nothing is plan to support it for the moment.

## I HAVE STUPID IDEA I WANT TO ADD

Fork, Dev, Pull Request.

```bash
# Magically run dev build with hotreload
npm run dev

# Build it
npm run build

# Make the terminal happy
echo "I'm happy."
```

## THINK IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA TO DO
 - More creative view
 - A menu to choose things
 - Shareable page (with param and all)
 - A chicken oriented theme


## ATM WE HAVE....
 - A classic view with dark filter on the background
 - A view with transparent text only working on -webkit- browser
 - A bob ross quote view
